\cite{bramble1989local} presents a general simple post-processing technique for mixed finite element approximations. This technique works for mixed finite element methods as long as there holds a superclose property of the finite element solution.

\cite{bramble1977higher} proposes a local superconvergence result for a large class of Ritz-Galerkin methods solving elliptic boundary value problems. The proposed scheme constructs a better approximation to the solution by employing a convolutional operator. To be specific, the scheme improves the accuracy from $\mathcal{O}(h^r)$ to $\mathcal{O}(h^{2r-2})$ for $r\ge 3$. This convolutional operator does not depend on the specific elliptic operator and is easily constructed.
